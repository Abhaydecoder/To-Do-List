# To-Do-List
I've created a user-friendly to-do list website designed to enhance productivity and organization. This platform allows users to easily add, edit, and delete tasks, ensuring they can keep track of their responsibilities effectively. 
# With a clean and intuitive interface, 
the website is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, making it convenient for users to manage their tasks on the go. Features such as priority settings, deadlines, and categorization help users stay focused and organized.
